This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a fun Wordle clone I am building as a side project.

Guess the word within 6 guesses. Each guess reveals correct letters and their positions if they contain any. Unlike the App it is based on, my version is repeatable as many times a day as a player is interested.

Upcoming

Tickets (and ideas)


Logic:
give up button showing the correct word
notifcation component
indicating letters already guessed
changeable word lengths
changeable number of guesses
try again button
add keystroke functionality


Style:
color scheme
new fonts
better spacing
animations for guesses
audio indicators for correct letters victory defeat etc
add icon for delete to look like phone delete

Full Stack:
Deploying
Database - track wins, users etc
